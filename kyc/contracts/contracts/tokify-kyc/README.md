# Sample

This is a sample contract which uses bindings for the core Warden Protocol blockchain functionality.

You can deploy it by itself, or you can use it as a starting point for your own contract.

Note that this is a preview, so only limited functionality available right now.
The sample contract exposes `NewKeyRequest` transaction and `AllKeys` query, but more are on the way!
