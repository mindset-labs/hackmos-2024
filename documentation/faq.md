# FAQ

## Non-technical

### Who can create a DAO Trust?
Any organization of people who can showcase the ability to handle the operational aspects of managing the DAO and its properties. For example: a real estate developer who wants to tokenize the sale of a newly developed asset. In the roadmap, we also plan on adding a fundraising mechanism such that assets don't have to be immediately owned to be tokenized but rather purchased after tokenization as part of the process.

### What are the roles and responsibilities of the DAO?
The DAO is in charge of making operational decisions about the property it is associated with.

### Who can list a property?
Any property owner can list an asset and open the tokenization to external investors in the underlying asset.

### How do I tokenize my property?
You can list your property on the TokiFy platform and set up your own rules and APY% for the associated shares. You must also be able to legally authorize the SPV (represented by the DAO) to become the legal operator of the property.

### What are the costs of tokenizing an asset?
The protocol will earn revenue by charging a 0.01% transaction fee similar to DEXes or NFT marketplaces as well as operational royalties on the properties it has under management.

This will enable users to easily launch diverse fractionalized investment funds and quickly tokenize their properties by only paying the network's fees and allows Tokify to grow its revenue based on value-based (usage) pricing.

TokiFy will also charge a 0.01% royalty fee when rent payments are made to ensure that ongoing support is always available.

### Why should I tokenize my property?
Tokenizing your property allows you to easily find investors willing to participate in the financing of your projects by allowing them to receive rewards from the revenue of the underlying asset.

### What assets can be tokenized?
Any assets can be tokenized but there needs to be an intrinsic value for investors. The easiest property to tokenize is real estate as it is an already emerging market in that space. Art could also be an interesting market for this new technology.

### How can I be sure that the asset tokenized is real and legit?
TokiFy works with local legal service providers making sure the assets registered are in compliance with local authority and are owned by the property's owner.

### How will I receive the rewards/income from my investment?
Your rewards will be distributed monthly and given in USDC/native tokens (TBD). We plan on enabling cross-chain payments such that rewards/income payments can be received on/from other chains.

### How does the APY calculation work?
The APY is inputted by the original property owner and should be counted as a projection and not an expected output. The DAO can provide a history if available for each particular property in the real world.

### What does an NFT represent?
The NFT represents a single share of your investment within the property. Each RWA / property can be a different number of total shares depending on the desired price per share at launch.

## Technical

### How are assets represented in smart contracts?
Each singular asset is represented as a smart contract which follows the CW404 standard and adds a few more wrapper functions around it to make it relevant to each type of DAO.

### How is the DAO governed?
DAOs are governed through a proposal and voting smart contract along with a treasury. Initially, the voting and proposals of the DAO are limited to the operators, however, each DAO can also have a governance token which represents voting rights over the entire DAO and its operations.

Voting on a single RWA is mostly governed by the shareholders of that particular asset.

### Which token standards are used within the technical implementation?
CW404, CW20, CW4, CW3 as well as other non-standard smart contracts that we hope to introduce as new standards.

## Regulation

### What is the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC)?
The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) is a financial-free zone in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, designed to promote and support the growth of financial services and businesses in the region. Established in 2004, DIFC provides a regulatory framework and infrastructure tailored for financial institutions, firms, and professionals.

### Is TOKIFY regulated?
Not yet. But it is an ongoing process. We are working to be able to operate in the UAE.

### What is a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)?
A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a separate legal entity created by a company to manage specific projects or investments while keeping financial risks separate. It helps protect the parent company's assets and limits its liability for those particular activities.

### What is an Asset LLC?
An Asset LLC is a type of limited liability company set up to own and protect specific assets, like real estate or investments. It helps safeguard those assets from legal risks and makes management easier, giving owners better control over their valuable property.
