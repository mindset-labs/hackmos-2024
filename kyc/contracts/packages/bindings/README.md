# Bindings

This crate provides bindings for the Warden Protocol blockchain core functionality.
You can use it in your own contracts to interact with a Warden Protocol.

Note that this is a preview, so only limited functionality available right now.
You can execute `NewKeyRequest` and query `AllKeys`, but more on the way!

To start using Warden Protocol from the CosmWasm contracts, please refer to the sample contract.
